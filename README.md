# NIOS
Fake simulated Linux like operating system with simple Bourne like shell in C# in Unity.
Maybe one day this "project" will evolve into something as cool as https://github.com/s-macke/jor1k

# What is this
- I always wanted to make fake simulated Linux like system in C#. One that you can use to make ingame computers. Such system implicitly brings emergent gameplay.
- Architecture tries to resemble Linux.
- Programs can use API that is the same as System.Console, System.Environment, System.IO.Path, System.IO.Directory, System.IO.File, System.IO.DirectoryInfo, System.IO.FileInfo
- You can add your real system files that will represent ingame storage devices.
- Those ingame storage devices can then be mounted with a ingame file system.
- Has simple bourne like shell capable of pipelining and output redirection.
- Has simple ecma 48 like console simulation.
