# NIOS
Fake simulated Linux like operating system with simple Bourne like shell in C#, Unity 3D

# What is this
- I always wanted to make fake simulated Linux like system in C#.
- One that you can use to make ingame computers.
- Such system implicitly brings emergent gameplay.
- Architecture is based on Linux.
- Programs can use api that is the same as System.Console, System.Environment, System.IO.Path, System.IO.Directory, System.IO.File, System.IO.DirectoryInfo, System.IO.FileInfo
- You can add your system files that will represent ingame storage devices.
- Those storage devices can then be mounted with a fake file system.
- Has simple bourne like shell capable of pipelining and output redirection.
- Has simple ecma 48 like console simulation.

In the future one could make something similar to this: https://github.com/s-macke/jor1k
