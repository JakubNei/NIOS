# NIOS
Fake simulated Linux like operating system with simple Bourne like shell in C#, Unity 3D

# What is this
always wanted to make fake simulated linux like system in C#,
one that you can use to make ingame real like computers,
architecture closely resembles linux,
programs can use api that is the same as System.Environment, System.IO.Path, System.IO.Directory, System.IO.File, System.IO.DirectoryInfo, System.IO.FileInfo,
a read/write stream device needs to be mounted with a file system to be able to store data, 
has simple CSV file system inspired by NTFS,
has simple bourne like shell capable of pipelining and output redirection
has simple ecma 48 console simulation

to do: users, groups, multi user environment, process management, network/sockets simulation
